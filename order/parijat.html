                                       The earthen pot must have a 16 inch diameter with three drainage holes made at the bottom as that is important to get rid of excess water from the pot.
Plant with the seeds or cut stem in the spring season
Avoid planting parijat in the winter season and avoid the seeds from germinating. 
The potting mix must be that of 50% normal garden soil and 50% any organic compost like vermicompost. Mix well and fill the tray. 
Each section must have one seed each and remember to maintain a 2 cm depth. 
Maintain the moisture but do not overwater.
