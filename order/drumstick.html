                                       The drumstick tree can be propagated by seeds, or by cuttings. In the latter, the branches of an existing tree are cut and then placed in the ground. The size of the branches should be around 1m long, and 4cm in diameter. It should be completely planted underground, and watered regularly. The yield from the cutting method of propagation is just as much from seeds, and is also common due to the relative ease of planting the cuttings, as compared to seeds.
