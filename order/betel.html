                                       <span> How to grow: </span>
                                       Take a 4-6 inches long cutting from a healthy plant. Make 45 degrees cut using a sharp knife just below the leaf node. Remove all leaves from the cutting except the top 2 ones. Dip the end in a rooting hormone and plant the cutting in a well-draining potting medium. Water well, and keep the pot where it gets bright, indirect light.
                                       You can also propagate the plant in water, but it’s not that effective—Put the cutting in a glass of fresh water and place it on the spot like a windowsill in indirect sunlight. Keep changing the water every 3-4 days. Once several roots appear, transplant the cutting into a pot with a well-draining potting mix.

                               The alkaloids in betel nut are the main active ingredients in research currently, while arecoline (methyl 1-methyl-3,6-dihydro-2H-pyridine-5-carboxylate) is considered the most important alkaloid in betel nut. It is the main active ingredient and also the major toxic compound.
