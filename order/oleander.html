                                       Plant oleander in a good-sized pot using a soil-based potting compost. Mixed with a third of coarse grit or perlite to ensure good drainage. Stand the pot where there’s no danger of waterlogging – inside, this can be on a large saucer of pebbles to protect surfaces, while outside the pot should be raised just off the ground if standing on paving.
