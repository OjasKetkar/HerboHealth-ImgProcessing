                                    Neem is thought to have originated in Assam and Burma (where it is common throughout the central dry zone and the Siwalik hills). However, the exact origin is uncertain: some say neem is native to the whole Indian subcontinent; others attribute it to dry forest areas throughout all of South and Southeast Asia, including Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.

                                            <li>The pulp from the fruit can be removed by rubbing it against a coarse surface when it is wet</li>
                                            <li> Wash the seeds and sow them as early as possible </li>
                                            <li>Cover them with an inch of the potting mix and keep the pot warm and wet. It takes 1-3 weeks for them to germinate. </li>
                                            <li>If you find it easier to start with a plant, put it in a large container with a drainage hole and add in a good potting mix. </li>
                                            <li>Give your neem tree lots of indirect sunlight at first. However, you should avoid prolonged periods in the sun until your tree shows signs of new growth. </li>
