                              <p> Most plants largely uptake carbon dioxide and release oxygen during the day, and uptake oxygen and release carbon dioxide at night. However, because of its ability to perform a type of photosynthesis called Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM), the Peepal trees can uptake carbon dioxide during the night as well.

The sacred fig is considered to have a religious significance in three major religions that originated on the Indian subcontinent, Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism.

                            Whole parts of Peepal like root bark, stem bark, roots, leaves and fruits are beneficial in managing conditions like poor digestion, high sugar level and skin problems. Peepal bark helps to control the frequency of diarrhea, whereas Peepal leaves promote quick healing due to their Ropan (healing) nature.

                                       1. Propagation from Seeds
                                       Peepal tree bonsai is simple to develop from seeds. All you have to do is sow them in a pot and keep them under a bright, indirect light source. You can move the pot to a brighter spot once the seeds germinate. Ultimately, you have to go for stem propagation from the plant that will grow from your seeds, which brings us to our next method.<br>
                                       2. Propagation from Stem Cuttings
                                       The stem of the parent plant can be cut off. The lower leaves are removed, leaving 2-3 leaves on top. After being coated in rooting hormone, the cutting is placed in damp soil. It is watered on a regular basis and placed in a location that receives enough sunshine.<br>
                                       3. Propagation from Marcotting
                                       For marcotting, a healthy stem is chosen and 1 centimeter of skin is removed from the stem. A plastic cover is placed over the wound and moist mud is applied around it. This aids in the retention of moisture. This is watered on a daily basis. Once the root develops from the cut, the stem can be trimmed and planted separately.
