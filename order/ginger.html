                                    Ginger is in the family Zingiberaceae. Ginger originated in Maritime Southeast Asia and was likely domesticated first by the Austronesian people. It was transported with them throughout the Indo-Pacific during the Austronesian expansion (c.â€‰5,000 BP), reaching as far as Hawaii.

                                Numerous active ingredients are present in ginger including terpenes and oleoresin which called ginger oil. Ginger also constitutes volatile oils approximately 1% to 3% and non-volatile pungent components oleoresin. The major identified components from terpene are sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and phenolic compounds which are gingerol and shogaol and lipophilic rhizome extracts, yielded potentially active gingerols, which can be converted to shogaols, zingerone, and paradol.
